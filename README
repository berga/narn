NARN - Not Another Rails Newsletter

Using the plugin

NARN require Engines so once you‘ve installed the engines plugin, you‘ll need to add a single line to the top of config/environment.rb just below the require for Rails’ own boot.rb file:

  require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

At the end of config/environment.rb add:

  gem 'mislav-will_paginate', '~> 2.2'
  require 'will_paginate'
    
To generate plugin migrations and add them to main flow of database evolution you should also run:

  script/generate plugin_migration
