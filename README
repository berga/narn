NARN - Not Another Rails Newsletter

NARN is a complete and useful newsletter for your rails application. It provides you a full functionality of newnletter. User can add his address to newsletter (with account activation) or unregister. You can create and send newsletters to all singned up users.

Using the plugin

To install plugin run in your application directory:

  ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/aenima/narn.git

NARN require Engines. If you haven't got them already installed in your application they will be installed autamatically.

You‘ll need to add a single line to the top of config/environment.rb just below the require for Rails’ own boot.rb file:

  require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

At the end of config/environment.rb add:

  gem 'mislav-will_paginate', '~> 2.2'
  require 'will_paginate'
    
To generate plugin migrations and add them to main flow of database evolution you should also run:

  ruby script/generate plugin_migration
  
Migrate them and that's everything what you have to do to use newsletter in your application. If you have for example sendmail everything should work fine.
