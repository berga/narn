NARN - Not Another Rails Newsletter

== Introduction

NARN is a complete and useful newsletter for your Rails application. User can add his address to a newsletter (with account activation) or unregister. You can create and send newsletters to all singned up users. Seems to be everything you can expect from a newsletter engine.

== Installation

To install plugin run in your application directory:

  ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/aenima/narn.git

NARN requires Engines. If you haven't got them already installed in your application, they will be installed automatically.

You'll need to add a single line to the top of config/environment.rb just below the require for Rails' own boot.rb file:

  require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

At the end of config/environment.rb add:

  gem 'mislav-will_paginate', '~> 2.2'
  require 'will_paginate'
    
To generate plugin migrations you should also run:

  ruby script/generate plugin_migration

== Usage
  
After installing the plugin and running migrations you're ready to go with NARN. Just like ActionMailer: it should work with sendmail out of the box, other solutions need a bit of configuration.
